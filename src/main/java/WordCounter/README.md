<h2>WORD FREQUENCY ANALYZER APPLICATION</h2>
This is a Java program that counts the number of words in a given file and calculates the frequency of each word. The program then prints out various statistics about the words in the file, such as the total number of words, the most frequently occurring word, and any words that have the same highest frequency. The program takes a file name as input. The program uses a Scanner object to read the file and a HashMap to store the frequency of each word. The program also uses various constants to format the output, including ANSI codes for colored output.

The main method of the program checks if the user has provided a file name as input. If no file name is provided, an error message is printed, and the program exits. If a file name is provided, the program attempts to open the file and count the words in it. If the file cannot be opened or is not a valid file, an error message is printed, and the program exits. If the file is successfully opened and read, the program prints out the statistics about the words in the file.
